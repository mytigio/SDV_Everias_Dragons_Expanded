[center][size=6]Everia's Dragons Expanded[/size][/center]
Updates and new Dragon Eggs for Everia's Dragon for 1.6 ([url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/20672/]https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/20672/[/url])

Dragons now dig like pigs for their harvests and can dig up multiple treasure items, including the new Dragon Eggs.
Dragons no longer give birth, but instead dig up Dragon Eggs as a Deluxe Good. Dragons can be hatched from Dragon Eggs if you have an incubator that can hold them.
Incubation time is 14 days, then maturity time is 14 days.
Adds baby textures to the dragons.
Dragon Eggs can be made into Dragon Mayonaise
Dragon Eggs can be used in new several new recipes:
[list]
[*] Sunfire Omelet
[*] Dragon Drop Soup
[*] Spicy Dragon Cake
[/list]

Fixes a bug with the textures in Everia's Dragons, which should resolve freezing.

[size=5]Compatability with Dwarven Expansion[/size]
If you have my other mod ([url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/22021?tab=files]Dwarven Expansion[/url]), this mod has several additional features, but is not required:

Dragons go in the Cavern instead of a normal Barn if you choose (config option to make the Cavern their default home.  Otherwise they can go in either Barn or Cavern.)
Dragons can be birthed from Dragon Eggs in Caverns.
Dragons are no longer sold at Marnie's.  Instead you can find Dragon Eggs occasionally for sale at the Adventurer's Guild which can then be hatched in a Cavern.
Dragon Eggs can be used to create decorative faberge egg in the Jewelry Maker.
Restores a sell price for Dragons (Everia's Dragons for 1.6 removed the sell price)
Dragon Eggs (any egg really, but traditionally Dragon Eggs) and Dwarven Spirits can be made into a Foaming Gin Dragon
